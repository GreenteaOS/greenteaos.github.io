## Greentea Operating System

[Read old Wiki here](https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Greentea)

Warm and cozy, open-source operating system compatible with existing apps and games

Greentea is an operating system based on open source code. The main idea of the project is to create a compatible environment for the existing software as fast and as qualitatively as possible and provide the user with the best experience with a personal computer.

Greentea OS is a free operating system written from scratch, but more user and production oriented. We would first make it *actually* usable for day-to-day use.

BEWARE! DO NOT INSTALL ON A PC! USE VIRTUAL MACHINES! GREENTEA IS UNSTABLE SOFTWARE!
